You Don't Know Everything

**A strategy to create agile organisations through emergence**

## Overview

This three-part 45-minute talk about agility introduces some principles and practices that we are applying at Acid Labs to build agile teams both within and outside of the software development industry.

## Abstract

Agile teams implement sets of practices which ensure them resilience. This form of robustness takes origin in the interactions between their team members that the practices provoke. That capacity to embrace change that a team acquires does not depend on individuals behavior and skills as much as in the collective effects of the rules they enforce. With that in mind, making explicit their own limitations, and showing how they compensate them through a set of carefully-chosen team practices and rules is an effective way for team leaders to demonstrate some collaboration benefits and also a successful strategy to agilize their teams and clients.
